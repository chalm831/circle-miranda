             Bootstrap by <b>Bardini</b> was yes, <i>very lengthy</i> and often drawn out. But for me as someone who is learning about these things that is what learning new things feels like. Between long sentences there were really interesting things said about the nature of computing.  I would argue that it is simply almost <strong>impossible</strong> to code “alone”. Everything is built upon someone else's work. That's what I believe the nature of this title is referring to. Loading a program into a computer using a much smaller program to load in the desired program. All building upon itself. This text exemplifies this nature. One piece never has just one author. The way Engelbart came to conceptualize the dynamics of his lab can serve as a model. There was a focus on developing not just efficient computing programs but also rich social working relationships between programmers.

            How much of your life can function without your personal computer?

            <i>You're so queen for that— </i> cannot relate. On to your question— probably not much. I take my computer everywhere with me I love her deeply. <small>My work requires it 100% I would die without it so I'd say it's pretty essential.</small> 

            Question for the people: what's your favorite webpage on the internet! (No relation, just felt like asking) Fun!
